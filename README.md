# reSpell.js (Number Speller)
Spells provided numbers using JavaScript (Up to 18 digits, or a hundred quadrillion)

## Note: This is still on beta. It's also incomplete. (there are more elegant, shorter and better scripts than this)

Majority of the code is on `reSpell.js`

For this to work on your own HTML code do the following:
- Create an `<input>` tag and assign the id `input` to it
- the target output must have assigned the id `output`
- A button or something that triggers the `spell()` function (it reads the input for the values)
- Or you can call `spell()` with a value like this:
```
spell(25);
```
