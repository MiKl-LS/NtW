# NtW (numbers to words)
Spells provided numbers using JavaScript (Up to 14 digits, or a hundred trillion)

## Note: This is still on beta. It's also incomplete (can't process decimals)

Majority of the code is on `index.js`

For this to work on your own HTML code do the following:
- Create an `<input>` tag and assign the id `input` to it
- the target output must have assigned the id `output`
- A button or something that triggers the `spell()` function (it reads the input for the values)
- Or you can call `spell()` with a value like this:
```
spellnumber(25);
```
